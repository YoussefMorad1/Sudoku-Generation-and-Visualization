* This is a GUI Program that uses BackTracking Algorithm to Create a unique (only one solution) Suduko Puzzle 
* The Program has an option to solve the puzzle after it's created
* The Program shows visual steps while creating the unique puzzle and while solving
* Creating the puzzle may take a long time that's why the program allows user to choose between 2 mod:
    * Stop Watch Mode: NO Time Limits -> The program will take his time creating the puzzle and trying to have as few clues as he can
    * Timer Mode: Time Limits -> User chooses a number of secs, the program stops when this timer ends (puzzle might have more clues)
